voices-of-dissent music contribution site project

Voices of Dissent is a music contribution project idea I hope will foster a community
of musicians for sharing protest/grievance songs during the current chaotic political climate.
Content may be any audio expression - songs, poetry, stories, essays - all shared for the purpose
of expression and statement.
