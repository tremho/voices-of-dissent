Yesterday got the main page working and I think it looks good.
Also got a start on the submit form, but it has a focus issue I need to debug.
Probably won't do much today, but it occurs to me that before we jump into the form
we need to check for/perform a log in.  This is a good case for Identity-TBD, and I should use
the RapidAPI version.  I will visit that site and follow my own docs to see how this goes.

###### Problems with Identity-TBD
The redirect that delivers the cookie value ?idtbd=xxxxx does not work if the redirect
url has a ? parameter already.  It should use a & instead.  The end result is that we get
two ? and the ?page comes out as the whole thing. we can pick out the idtbd, but that
does not work entirely because the idtbd code does not see the cookie value and does not
get the associated identity object.

TODO: Fix IDTBD

for now - see if I can restructure so that we do log in on the main page 
yeah -- let's do it this way:
- put the login as per sample into mainpage.tsx
- if we have idtbd, then enable a log out button
- on share button, if we don't have idtbd, go to login
- if we do have idtbd, route to page

---
so the problem now is that we log in at LoginCheck but that redirects us back to the 
main page. So I need a state setter back to main so main can check if it should go 
instead to upload.

---
Aw, IDK.  I got it sort of working a couple of hacky ways, but I think I need to revisit this again
and put a login button on the main screen (and a logout)
If we click on 'share' and we don't have an identity, we say "log in first"
If we have one (cookie or return from login), then we can go to upload.
the only real difference between this and what we have now is that in either case, 
once we log in we go back to the main screen instead of going to upload.  If we have
a log in button and an indicator (and a logout button as part of that), it mitigates 
the problem.
Indicator could be something like 'logged in as who@where.com' or 'user xxddid-dishf0ehf'
depending on the metadata we have.

Didn't do much today, but did get the account login/logout stuff in place with avatar and name
and all that sexy stuff, and the flow works.

Still to do:

- [X] replace placeholder alert with an actual html info page advising login
- [X] have a spinner overlay. main page. Do this on login and on status "processing"

Then lots to do on getting the upload form in shape.

Okay. Got the upload starting.  The premise is that we send the top-level information, which 
creates the main data object, and then we start chunked file uploads.
When all is done, we open the top level object again and add the id references to the
assets (or the urls). Which we could pretty much guess, I think because it is formulaic, 
but anyway the end result is neat and tidy.

We have the first part of that done.
Next is to do a file upload (art is first, but it's the same for both)
and then the final binding.

I guess I'm tracking alright.  Upload of submission is done and data inspection
seems to indicate it all is good. Public Urls play fine.

Need to pick up some loose ends and tech debt before doing the playback pages that
use this though, first.

- [X] put RapidAPI key and any other secrets under Coverterage
- [x] document and set defined types for the functions we created
- [X] add mime type mappings for various image and audio formats (default to octet-stream)

- [X] create a "submission guidelines" page prior to the actual upload page.
- [X] add artist name to the form. Prepopulate this with what we got from the identity
- [X] expand on this so that we record the latest artist name for the identity and that 
is what we use for the identity name.
- [ ] fix the file selection / display portion of UploadPage

After all of this is done, design the playback experience.

As brief - 
- default playlist is all content, shuffled
- this all appears in a table that has sort and search actions at each column top so you can
sort by artist or title or search text in either to find an individual listing
- selecting both will order by title/by artist
- deselecting both will represent the shuffled order of play
- the table has links for the individual page
- the individual page has all the metadata and the url
- the individual page has like feature
- the individual page has a dislike feature
- like/dislike are limited to logged in users so we can record under that id
- but likes/dislikes also show up as totals on the item info page
- when a logged-in user opts to play the playlist, their liked selections will be front-loaded
and they will not hear any of their disliked items. 

- playing the playlist will play each item according to shuffled order, excluding dislikes
- if user is not logged in, they will get a playlist of everything.

Got some of the checklist done, but added the item to fix the file selection / display.

I got it kind of working (the wrong way)

what would be better is something like this:

- a single target block that will accept both images and audio
- select file is below the display (instructions or fileshow)
- we determine at attach time which is which
- Fileshow shows stats and image and audio control

But we encountereed a problem with the way CGPT did the drag/drop div
So it gave me an entirely different solution when I complained.

Tomorrow:
- [X] Let's implement that
- [X] the blur effect is not working on Chrome. Probably the webkit extension. use both props.
- [X] make a 'ready()' function we can query at start for all gates ready on MainPage. Display spinner if not ready.

Then, maybe, do the playback page

----
3/26/25

Ready to do that. First I need to try to not fall off of a roof.

got a nascent table with fake data in place, thanks to chatGPT
Now need:
- [X] search button needs to be an icon instead of the word search
- [X] sort needs to include an unsorted option.

I guess I'm done for today, but need next to think about layout on this page

```
[table][player]
----
selection info
title, artist, description
like
``` 

let's take the 'favorite' off the table and put it down below.
The logged in shuffle will still prioritize liked songs.

if a song is selected and the sort is changed, the currently selected item is found in the list
and the list is repositioned to this new location.
if a search filter operation removes the current selection from the list, then
playback stops.

changing include will not unless this is the current track, then it goes to the next

Playback always follows the displayed list. if include is unchecked on the current item, 
the next track is advanced.

- [X] frame out the layout
- [X] gather actual data
- [ ] submit actual material
- 

3/28/25
Like button is working as expected now.

completion checklist
- [X] Playback as list
- [X] Persist skip selections
- [ ] allow edit of own material *
- [X] remove cover warnings - people can deal with it themselves. VOD can honor take-down requests.

- [X] advance row - export via reportBack pass-in
so ListenPage has the useState that sets the handler it sees returned from MusicTable
and forwards this to NowPlaying which calls it on an audio end.

- [X] reveal selection
- [X] skip action
- [X] record skip action
- [X] share song url, page url
- [X] page track= view

I screwed something up in the record skip action. Now nothing works.
- [X] take out the record skip stuff and limit it to just skip from scratch, no service call to /skip
- once we have it working like that again
  - [X] get the skips per user. 
  - [X] include a temporary clean if we have the object embedded
  - [X] set skips per user again

-----
- [X] add an alert for upload complete, then return to main page
- [X] insure no repeats on covers

----
Of course, now that I've done that I find problems that may be hard to fix

- [ ] none of the audio files play. The shared url plays
  - the url in the audio player is correct
  - what else could it be?

works in chrome, but not safari.  Safari may be corrupt. Reboot and retry.


- [ ] the artist name is undefined
  - it shows up this way in the upload page
  - it shows up as undefined for all the track listings
  - artistName is set correctly in the track data json
  - artistName is "undefined" in the top-level info, though
  - check Info function and its callers

- Uploader
- [X] content-type mapping fix
- Upload page
- [X] spinner should cover while uploading
- Listen page
- [X] tracks should be shuffled
- [X] description in listing should be limited with truncation ellipses
- [ ] we do need an edit feature now 
  - show edit button if identity of song matches login id
  - edit takes us to upload with &edit=songId

- upload edit
- [ ] read edit info and commute to inputs
- [ ] on submit we need to make sure we update instead of add

----
we need the user identity to be passed down to the EditIfOurs control. It will
compare this to the artistId passed in the props from the row 

hendleEdit will load page=upload&edit=<item id>

upload will look for edit, and if it finds it, it will fetch that data and use
it to populate the inputs

we need to figure out edit vs. copy/delete. Edit seems best. still need delete.

if we have art or audio to upload, do that
get the existing data, merge in new data
use new art/audio urls from upload (if we have them) otherwise keep the same
resave data

----
edit  is working (nominally)
- [ ] supress submissions popup on edit
- [ ] alert should say update or upload depending on edit
- [ ] post upload should go to listen instead of home
- [ ] handle delete case
  - delete function
    - delete data object
    - delete art and audio objects from art/audio

----
okay, I'm out of time now.
But editing (not sure if this is true of any edit, or just assets) creates corruption.
apparently it creates a zombie duplicate. But I can't rule out cross-contamination.

- Use the delete function to delete everything.
- check console to see if this looks like it cleaned it all as expected

actually, no. Looks like assets were being uploaded to undefined artist.
Everything cleaned now, manually.

- [X] Add a new submission
- [X] edit the text on this submission, look for issues in list
- [X] edit the content on the submission, look for issues
  - while at it, check the single asset case
- proceed based on findings.

----
- [X] click on title on ListenPage and UploadPage takes us home
- [X] Upload page title should say edit if editing

----
April 1, 2025

It's looking ready! Hopefully this is not an April fool's joke on me.

- checking it now.
- publish and try remote
- I'm guessing the path references will fail because of AWS stage
- try attaching published to tremho and see if that fixes the stage problem
- do we see any problems online?
