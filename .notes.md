## Rising from fools

This April Fool's project started as a sanity check on MistLift.
Now I'm going to use it to recreate VOD, one integration at a time since I can't get
the completed version to deploy at all.

I'll note progress here.

###### 4/3/25
When I'm 64 I'll be debugging code.

- [ ] Secrets seems like a no-brainer to bring over first
  - At this point, it fails.
  - I will now remove Secrets and see if I can get back
  - I _can_ get back.  hello and foobar work and app.js is loaded and runs, but
  - it of course fails at /secrets
  - secrets back, works locally...
  - on this new deploy, it is responding (except it is failing -- check logs)
  - it was unpublished. 
  - in-app service requests are missing Dev prefix
  - had to bump secrets up to 5 seconds
  - whoo! progress! now, it's up to covers...

  - now we can bring them in one at a time to see
  - [X] just secrets (+ hello + foobar)
  - [X] covers
  - [X] info
  - [X] delete
  - [X] like -- deploys, but the calls fail because of empty values
  - [ ] skips
  - [ ] tracks 
  - [ ] upload stuff

- page references need stage (ServiceEndpoint)

----
###### end of day
See what {proxy+} provides to the function -- test this with foobar, for example

- Does it make sense to recode tracks/likes to use this form?
  - Yes
- Does it make sense to get rid of FileServe?
  - Doesn't seem to work in a test

----
4/4/25

with the proxy+ in place, likes and tracks are accessible, but I need to change the calling
for them. Must past at least one parameter.

Need to make sure functions are protected against bad input

skips is acting weird, but I think if I clear out all identity info it will fix it.

did I see a problem with ?idtbd after login?  where does this come from?

looks like none of the upload functions are non-toxic

skips is no longer working at all.

---
##### 4/5/25 
### Checklist

- [X] covers not called on first run 
  - or ever? Need more cowbell.  Network tab says it was called
- [X] undefined called
  - Need more cowbell. Might be the missing covers?
- [ ] login +?
  - Big problem here because this comes from identity-tbd (see if its in npm js to fix)
  
- [X] covers and info CORS fail
  - Don't know because it's not getting called now
- 
- [ ] skips 500
  - Same. Check logs
- [ ] tracks 500
  - Check logs

- [ ] upstart/undefined
  - Same.  Let's figure out why -- cloudwatch
- 


trying to prematurely associate with services.tremho.com/vod to see if that helps
- [X] need to add to route table





----
###### Things I'm finding as I go

- [ ] add a mkdir .package_temp before publish
- [X] remove the post-binding console output we added recently
- [X] do a deploy before publish
- [ ] don't forget the client-side getAssetUrl for inverse-y possibility

-----
- [X] we have a schema complaint. must be from Secrets.
- [X] died during binding without mention.
-----

###### 4/9/25 - new upload strategy
The base64 size problem is real, and may be my last sticking point (although there is
still plenty of flakiness to be had elsewhere)

New Idea:

###### beginStagedUpload
  - establishes a bucket for the unique file transfer
  - returns bucket name (a hash)
###### uploadChunk
  - sends an arbitrary sized chunk that becomes a base64 object in the bucket
###### completeUpload
  - starts a multipart upload and gets the id
  - lists the bucket and reads all the base64 and assembles a binary block until it reaches above 5MB
  - send this 5MB chunk as a part to the multipart
  - shift the amount > 5MB down and adjust the offset, then continue reading and sending chunks
  - complete the upload and return the url

---------
Do this in another project to test
first, try a binary transfer and if we can make that work, maybe we do that.

-----
So binary transfer still isn't working - I thought the experiment outside was enough, 
but I didn't actually verify the data, so now I see there is a problem.

the sizes of the arrayBuffers sent vs. received do not match.

I don't want to cut bait for the b64 thing because now I've invested a binary commitment
and need to support it.


------
4/13/25

Put check points at all intercepts in express pipeline and see if data changes along the way
check the isBuffer, byteLength, and first 16 bytes

I can finally report success in an aws deployment.
I just have one bug I've found to fix, which I'll do local before making a next deploy.

So many things needed to change to make this work.
At least now I have a more robust framework for the future.

- [X] fix issues locally
  - skip list not sticking.  I already raised the timeout, but there's probably more to this.
  - Remove the alert at end of upload (I think I did this already)
- [ ] migrate to voices-of-dissent project and update repository
- [ ] build for AWS
- [ ] attach to services.tremho
- [ ] announce to rich, ron, paul, jessica.
- [ ] target public announcement on Friday, 4/18
